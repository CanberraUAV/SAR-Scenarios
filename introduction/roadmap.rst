Development Road-map
====================

This project has a short term plan and a long term plan.

Short term plan
---------------

The objectives of the short term plan are:

 * discover new requirements / scenarios
 * obtain more elaborate information about known scenarios
 * validate requirements by finding people in the SAR community that can verify the requirements are real
 * develop a vehicle to focus / nurture relationship with the SAR community

Activities of the short term plan are:

 * list and describe various relevant hypothetical stories
 * seek SAR community review/feedback
 * update scenarios, summarise feedback,
 * keep iterating as long as we keep getting valuable feedback

When we have a well-validated (by SAR community) short list of scenarios that are compatible with CanberraUAV technical development goals (OBC 2014), change focus.

Outstanding questions related to the short term plan:

 * apart from the user-story itself, what meta data do we need to capture?
 * how to evaluate the usefulness of each scenario? voting system / straw poll?
 * how to relate user-stories to technology features? how to get these requirements driving development?

Long term plan
--------------

The short term plan describes the first of four phases, which might be though of as *requirements discovery*. The subsequent phases are about delivering practical solutions to some of the key requirements.

The second phase will be *requirements elaboration*. In this phase we will identify some stories that are well matched to CanberraUAV development goals, and seek more detailed information about them. For example identify variations/alternatives, operational/functional requirements, conduct risk and hazard analysis, etc.

During the second phase, we may participate in table top exercises and workshops. Ongoing technology development will continue during all phases of this project (although it will increasingly be driven by the requirements documented here), however during the second phase we expect to be able to demonstrate progress against some of the requirements at this stage.

The third phase will be *experimental joint exercises*, which is where we will demonstrate that free, open source UAV technology is capable of being useful tool to emergency services.

The fourth phase is *transitional capability*, which will be whatever it needs to be to get these useful tools into active service.
