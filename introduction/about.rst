About this document / project
=============================

The theories behind this project are:

 * documented user-stories might be a good way for us to engage SAR community
 * iterating over documented user-stories might be a development path to joint exercises with the SAR community (i.e. user stories evolve into workshops, desktop exercises, experimental field exercises, etc)
 * engagement with the SAR community over user-stories might drive "real world" qualities into our next OBC entry.

We know we have been successful if:

 * the SAR community are motivated to contribute content to the user-stories
 * the SAR scenarios prove useful in helping us prioritise technology development efforts
