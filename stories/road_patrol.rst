Patrolling previously searched areas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Roads are rapidly searched during the early phase of a search. During later stages of the search (for example when the ground based teams are occupied with grid searches) it's possible that the target will self-rescue and arrive on a road. During these later stages, there would be value in repeatedly re-searching (patrolling) the roads from the air.

Mission Profile ideas:

 * RFS: check fire trails on day of fire, where to send the blokes with the chainsaws?
 * Parks: periodic check of fire trails
